       Sudoku is an old logic style puzzle game that has been around for atleast 200 years and probably longer.
       The objective of sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid with the numbers 1-9. The restrictions are that you may not
       repeat the same number in the same row, column, or one of the smaller 3x3 squares that make up the board.
       The dificulty level of each board is generally determined by the amount of starting numbers in the grid, where
       the fewer the amount of numbers, the harder the puzzle is to solve. Along with the classic version of sudoku
       there are many different branches with extra rules or a different grid to make the game more fun and challenging.
       Sudoku gained widespread popularity in 1986 when it was published by a Japanese puzzle company called Nikoli.

       Below are a few examples of the many variations of Sudoku.
