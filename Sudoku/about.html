	<p class="textclass">    "Hello, my name is Kevin Griffin and I am the creator of this website and online I go by vongola. I am currently a student at FTCC in Fayetteville NC.
        My original vision for this website was using the Django Python web framework and making a webapp that solves sudoku puzzles, however I will have to settle for borrowing.
        I enjoy playing video games (I have over 3000 hours in CSGO), Hunting and Fishing, and playing with my daughter.
